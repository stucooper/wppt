\chapter{Tournament Stages}

Broadly there are three stages to a Fast Pub Poker Tournament;
Early, Middle and Late.

\begin{description}

\item[Early] A lot of players think that the Early Stage of a
Tournament is where you fold a lot, to establish a tight image,
that will be to your benefit later on when you need to start
stealing blinds and bluffing more.

There's some merit to this line of thought, but for me every stage
of a Poker Tournament is about winning chips. You can make
your Position Plays from the very first hand of the Tournament,
establishing your Maniac image at a time when losing a few pots
doesn't cost you much.

During the early stages when stacks are still 40BB or more, you can
play the Cracking Hands; suited connectors, one-gappers and weird
low card hands. If you can get an early payoff and double up with
one of these hands, you'll be in a great position both
Chipwise and Imagewise.

If you play No Limit Holdem Cash games, the Early stage of a Tournament
is where your cash skills are most appropriate. Later on, as stacks
are shorter, you have to use Tournament skills more and Cash skills less.

\item[Middle] The middle stages of a Fast Tournament are from the
fourth blind level to the Final Table. A few players (maybe 10\%)
have busted out already and stack sizes are now very different
at the table.

One traditional piece of Tournament Wisdom is to target the Small Stacks.
You threaten them with elimination if they call you all-in and lose.
Again this line of thought has merit but unless you're up against
a very passive player, a small stack will sooner or later take a stand.

Layne Flack says the correct approach is to target the average stacks.
They've got enough chips that they can afford to make a good fold,
but not so many chips that they'll call you and still be OK if they lose.
Target the average stacks.

\item[Late] The first thing you do at the final table is to act cool
and look like you belong. You make final tables all the time, this is
nothing special. The other players will all be doing the same
thing, everyone's a champion.
