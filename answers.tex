8.1 (a) EV = P(win) x (amount won) - P(loss) x (amount lost) \\
= (18/38) x 10 - (20/38) x 10 \\
= (180/38 - 200/38) \\
= (-20/38) \\
= -0.53 = -53 cents

(b) This is the same house edge as pick the exact number, the bets are
equally fair.

8.2 EV = P(win) x (amount won) - P(loss) x (amount lost) \\
-0.5  = (1/4)  x (amount won) - (3/4) x \$10 \\
(x4 both sides) -2 = (amount won) - 30 \\
(+30 both sides) 28 = (amount won) \\

So a \$10 Exact Number Keno bet with an EV of -5\% should return
\$38.

8.3 P(loss) = (20/38) = .52 \\
P(loss) ^ 5 = .52 x .52 x .52 x .52 x .52 \\
= 0.038 = 0.04 \\

The gambler has a 4\% chance (1 in 25) of losing five bets in a row
and going bust.
