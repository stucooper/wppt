Before we go any further I need to say a few things about
some style choices used in this book.

\section*{Eight Player Tables}

Unless specified otherwise, all hands in this book assume an
8-player table. A lot of Fast Pub Poker Tournaments use
round eight-player tables with foldup legs and a drink holder
in the table for each seat. These tables are easy for a single TD
to fold into a large disc and roll away as the tournament
field shrinks.

\section*{Offsuit card holdings}

When an offsuit holding is shown, Hearts/Clubs are used, to make
it easier to see on paper that this is an offsuit holding. Obviously
six offsuit combinations are possible (Hearts/Clubs, Hearts/Diamonds,
Hearts/Spades, Spades/Clubs, Spades/Diamonds, Diamonds/Clubs).
This book uses a red suit/black suit pairing so it's easier on your eyes.

\section*{Stack sizes}

Stack sizes are often expressed as a multiple of the Big Blind (BB),
rounded intelligently. With a stack of 26,500 with blinds at 1,000/2,000
then you've got 13BB. A 39,150 stack at the same blind level is 40BB.
Also 'k' is used as an abbreviation for 'thousand', the two stacks
shown are 26.5k and 39k stacks with blinds at 1k/2k.

\section*{High to low flop}

The flop is always shown from high card down to low card, left-to-right,
regardless of the true order. You should think of the flop as a
simultaneous three card reveal, so really there is no true order. The turn
and river are always shown to the right of the flop.
