Some words on the style choices in this book.

\section*{Eight Player Tables}

Hands in this book assume an Eight-player table. A lot of Fast Pub
Poker Tournaments use round Eight-player tables with foldup legs and a
drink holder in the table for each seat. These tables are easy for a
single TD to fold into a large disc and roll away as the tournament
field shrinks and tables are combined. A final table of Nine players
is assumed.

\section*{Suited and Offsuit holdings}

When offsuit hole cards are shown, I use Hearts/Clubs, to make
it easy to see on paper that this is an offsuit holding. If the
holding is a Pocket Pair I use Spades/Clubs, which will
attract your attention and help you see that a pocket pair is in play.
Suited holdings are shown using the suit of Diamonds.

I shoved with \Ah\tenc\ but had no chance against \Ad\Kd\ and \Js\Jc\ .

%% \section*{Stack sizes}

%% Stack sizes are often expressed as a multiple of the Big Bet/Big Blind
%% (BB), rounded intelligently. With a stack of 26,500 with blinds at
%% 1,000/2,000 then you've got 13BB. A 39,200 stack at the same blind
%% level is 40BB. A lowercase k is used as an abbreviation for thousand,
%% the two stacks shown are 26.5k and 39k stacks with blinds at 1k/2k.

\section*{High to low flop}

The flop is always shown from high card down to low card,
regardless of the card order. The flop is a simultaneous three card
reveal, so the order is unimportant. The turn is shown to the right of
the flop and the river is shown to the right of the turn.

The Board for Joe Hachem's 2005 WSOP Final Hand was
\sixh\fived\fourd\As\fourc\ .

\section*{Example hands}

Most of the example hands are from my own play, or hands I've
witnessed myself. A few of them are from the WSOP Main Event
of 2005, which was a memorable poker tournament for many reasons.

\begin{itemize}
  \item It was won by Australia's Joe Hachem. This created a lot of
    media interest in Australia which led to the Pub Poker boom.
  \item The ESPN coverage of the event, with commentary from
    Lon McEachern and Norman Chad, is extensive and
    excellent. Excerpts from this coverage can be easily found on
    YouTube. I own about five hours of 2005 Main Event coverage on
    DVD, which I watched in my early poker years, and I remember a lot
    of the featured hands very well.
  \item Dan Harrington uses four examples from this tournament in his
    book Harrington on Holdem Volume 3: The Workbook. If the hands are
    good enough for Dan, they're good enough for me.
  \item The start stack of the tournament was 10,000 in
    chips. Although blind levels were very long (two hours)
    players quickly became short on chips once they lost some pots.
  \item There were a lot of inexperienced players in the tournament,
    chasing their poker dream after the previous year's win of
    Internet qualifier \textbf{Chris Moneymaker.} Chris Moneymaker is
    the 2004 winner's real name and he borrowed some cash to fly to
    Las Vegas from his friend David Gamble. You couldn't make this up.

\end{itemize}

%% I've found I learn more from watching WSOP hands than I do
%% from World Poker Tour hands. I have WPT Season 1 on DVD and don't feel
%% a strong urge to re-watch it. World Poker Tour normally films just the
%% final table so you're already watching shove and call final table
%% poker. You can learn a lot of Final Table play from WPT, but for early
%% stage and middle stage play, watching WSOP hands will teach you more.

\section*{Writing this book}

If you think playing poker is hard (and it is) then you should try
writing a poker book; which is about four times harder again. This book
nearly drove me mad; I've written other books before and this one has
been by far the hardest book to write, to proofread and to
finish. I'm very happy that it's finally over. I've enjoyed working on
the book, and it's helped my game a lot and I'm proud of the finished
product.

A lot of the final work on this book was done during the 2020
Coronavirus COVID-19 shutdown, when nobody could play pub poker,
Casino poker or even home game poker. With a lot of time on my hands,
working on the book was a good reminder of happier poker times. The
COVID-19 shutdown was the worst Bad Beat I've ever seen in poker.

\section*{What you won't find in the book}

This book is all about how to play No Limit Texas Holdem Fast
Tournaments in a non-Casino, Pubs-and-Clubs setting. There's one or
two ideas from Cash poker, Fixed Limit poker and Online poker in the
book, and a tiny bit of Omaha and the tiniest bit of Seven Card Stud.
But this is \textbf{not} a book about how to play poker online, or how
to play Cash poker or Omaha or Stud.

There's no advice given on Tournament Direction or how to run Home
Games. This is a book for pub poker players, written by a pub poker
player.

Or perhaps an ex-player. I mostly play Cash Pot Limit Omaha these days;
a thrilling action game where you can win or lose hundred of dollars
in three minutes, compared to a Poker Tournament where you lose most of
the time and only occasionally make a big score. Pot Limit Omaha
is like Crystal Meth compared to No Limit Texas Holdem's Cigarette
Smoking. Don't smoke and stay well away from Ice, but give Omaha a go
sometime.

I've got big Omaha games on Friday nights, Saturday nights and Sunday
nights so even without a pub poker game I still get about twenty hours
of poker action a week.

\section*{Exercises}

% FINALFIXME: Check the number of exercises is 20

There are 20 Exercises in this book, scattered at the end of some of
the chapters. Have a go at them using a pen and notepaper. There's no
passing or failing, they just test your understanding of the
material. All of the answers are provided at the back. Some of the
exercises need you to search on Google or YouTube, if you don't know
the answers already. A few need Maths and some needs a calculator. The
Exercises are numbered by their chapter.

\arabic{chapter}.1 (Google search) Which poker player won the World
Series Main Event in the 1980s, recovering from having just one chip
left, which led to the phrase that all you need to win a Poker
Tournament is ``a Chip and a Chair''?
