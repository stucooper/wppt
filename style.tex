Before we go any further I need to say a few things about
the style and presentation of this book.

\section{Eight Player Tables}

Unless specified otherwise, all hands in this book assume an
8-player table. A lot of Fast Pub Poker Tournaments use
round eight-player tables with foldup legs and a drink holder
in the table for each seat. These tables are easy for a single TD
to fold into a large disc and roll away as the tournament
field shrinks.

\section{Offsuit card holdings}

When an offsuit holding is shown, Hearts/Clubs are used, to make
it easier to see on paper that this is an offsuit holding. Obviously
six offsuit combinations are possible (Hearts/Clubs, Hearts/Diamonds,
Hearts/Spades, Spades/Clubs, Spades/Diamonds, Diamonds/Clubs).
This book uses a red suit/black suit pairing so it's easier on your eyes.
