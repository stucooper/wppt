\chapter{Introduction}

% Last updated: 20200519

Small buyin No Limit Holdem Pub Poker Tournaments are excellent
entertainment and gambling opportunities for players prepared to do
some work. This book is all about how to play these games.

There are many different kinds of Poker tournament, I'll cover these
soon in the chapter ``Types of Pub Tournaments''. For now a
working definition of a small buyin
Pub Poker Tournament is a game with a single once-only entry fee of
between \$10 and \$40 dollars, which will be played by 10 to 50
players and will be finished in less than 4 hours.

\section{The APW Era}

I first worked on this book at the height of the first Sydney Pub
Poker Boom, in what I call the APW Era. APW is Australian Poker
Weekly, a newspaper exclusively on Poker that ran from January 2009 to
June 2011. I was a columnist for APW, writing the column
``Doctor Straight by Stuart Cooper''. Most of the articles were on my
Pub Tournament games, with a few about Casino trips and cash games.

APW had full-page advertisements for Online Poker sites (FullTilt
and PartyPoker in those days) and after the FBI shut down Online Poker
in ``Black Friday'' on April 15, 2011 that was beginning of the end
for APW and also the end of the first Pub Poker boom. The second
contraction for Pub Poker was the June 2011 banning of cash Timed
Tournament games, the Chip-Chops.

I've reproduced two of my APW articles in this book.

\section{Standard Poker Books}

% \section*{name} : an unnumbered section that won't appear in the contents

Most of the standard classic No Limit Holdem Poker Tournament books
focus on big stack poker tournaments with slow blind increases.
I'm thinking of books by Dan Harrington, David Sklansky, Lee Nelson
and T J Cloutier. Slow tournaments are about patience, endurance,
trapping and shifting gears. Pub poker is a much
shorter, faster game, so a different approach
is required. I encourage you to read the
classic authors, and also to play in slow deepstack tournaments,
but keep in mind that a different set of skills is required to succeed
in the fast Pub games. This book concentrates on these fast
tournament skills.

Just as the advice of Harrington and the others isn't always right
for fast Pub Poker games, my advice isn't good
for big buyin deepstack games, and is even worse for
cash games. If you want to succeed in the big games you'll have to do a
lot more work and reading than what you'll find in this book.

The best book on how to play Fast No Limit Holdem Tournaments
(besides this one) is The Poker Tournament Formula by Arnold Snyder.
I look at this fantastic book more in the chapter ``Position Plays''.
Make sure you get ``The Poker Tournament Formula'' and not the followup,
``The Poker Tournament Formula 2'', which is about slower big buyin games.
Get PTF2 later, but start with the original which is targetted to fast
NLH tournaments which is exactly what a single night pub tournament is.

% FIXME: This next paragraph belongs somewhere else I think
You can win your way into big buyin games through fast games,
so fast games skills can help get you cheap entry into the big games.
Also even slow games become fast games once the blinds get too big,
so you'll need fast game skills even in games that start slow.

\section{The Internet changes too fast}

The Internet is great for looking up quick bits of information but
websites change too quickly to be useful to write about in this book.
If you  ever click on the reference links at the bottom of a
Wikipedia article you'll find that over half of them just don't work;
news sites have deleted the articles linked to. Some bookwriters put a
big list of links in their bibliography and add ``visited March 2020''
as if to say that ``well, hey, it worked for me!!'' but that's not
good enough for me and for this book. If I tell you that something's
on Super System 2 page 146; you'll be able to find that (with some
effort and maybe some cost to you) ten years from now; you won't be
able to do that if I give you a link to a page on a website that won't
be there in even a year's time.

\section{Enjoy your poker}

As well as presenting strategies to help you succeed
in pub tournaments,
I also write about how you can enjoy your poker
more. Poker can be a very enjoyable game if you approach
it with the right attitude, but I see many players at the table
not having a good time. I don't think there's much
point playing if you're not enjoying it.

Usually the grouches make the game bad for the other
players as well. If you have a good time at the table, you'll make the
game better for the others as well, at the same time as you're taking
their chips.

In the same way as you should look for games where you'll have
a good chance of playing well and winning, you should
also look for games where you'll enjoy yourself.
If you can find somewhere where you like
the organisers, the players, the venue and the other things
you can do at the venue when you're out of the action,
you'll have some great poker experiences.

\section{Gambling}

Poker is a gambling
game: a game with a skill component certainly but still
a gambling game. You can be all-in for your tournament life
as a 70\% favourite and easily lose. There are plenty of problem gamblers
in Australia, mostly on poker machines in the Pubs and Clubs
(the same Pubs and Clubs you'll be playing Holdem Poker
in) but also horses, greyhounds, sports, lotteries and even Keno.

Poker's a seductive and addictive game,
and tournaments can be played from all stakes from free to \$10 to \$100
to \$1000 to \$10,000 to \$100,000. Make sure you're keeping it fun
and enjoying your poker. Make sure you're in control at all times,
and if it stops being fun, stop doing it. Keep your life in balance.

% next stuff looks like GUFF
%% Some of the better pub poker players I know are actually
%% self-excluded from The Star Casino in Sydney. They've had
%% their problems with cash poker or the bigger buyin poker games or
%% House games like Blackjack, Baccarat and Roulette. They've
%% made the choice to stay out of the Casino and play smaller poker games,
%% where they can relax and enjoy themselves. That's a really smart
%% move, and I think well of these players for making that choice.

\section{Disclaimer}

This book is written with all care taken but no responsibility accepted.
Following my suggestions does not guarantee success.
There's plenty of different ways to play poker, think about poker
and write about poker. You might disagree with some of my advice.
That's fine. At a minimum, this book should help you think
more clearly about your poker.

I've lived with this book for many years and revised every chapter
carefully at least twice. I can honestly say that this is the best
poker book that I'm capable of producing.

\section{Pub Trivia and Pool Competitions}

In my University years (1989-1992) my Mum and my brother Craig and I
used to play in a lot of Pub Trivia nights, in the Newcastle
area. Some of them had an entry fee and guaranteed prizemoney, other
games were for the benefit of schools or charities, with donated
prizes. Small weekly games were no-entry-fee freerolls which were
social games that could be found in pubs and clubs across Newcastle.

We took our Trivia seriously, and had some good wins and
great nights out. A lot of the other teams weren't taking the games
seriously and never did as well as we did.

After a while we'd recognize other trivia regulars. They were also
taking the games seriously and playing a few nights a week and going
from venue to venue to find the best Trivia nights. Just like we
were.

Before Trivia there was a scene of Pool Competitions. Pool
comps and Trivia are still around, but today one of the main Pub
entertainments is Poker Tournaments.

I still play Pub Trivia and I'm very good at it, but these days
I only play about eight times a year. I'm decent at pool, and even
better at full-table snooker, but don't play in Pub pool comps.

You'll see familiar faces at your pub poker games,
regular players who are taking the game seriously. Alongside them
will be more social players, who might be regulars at the venue
and some regular players who just aren't very good. They're playing
poker regularly, but they're not working on their game and they're
just going through the motions the way they always have and always
will.

% FIXME: Add footnote of Rob ``The Coach'' Fulton
I once played the first Million Dollar winner of Australian ``Who
Wants to be a Millionaire'' at Pub Poker! His name is Rob ``The
Coach'' Fulton, so nicknamed as he has the same name as legendary
Manly Rugby League coach Bob Fulton. Millionaire Rob Fulton was very
much a poker beginner, and called a river bet on a board of JTT98
holding A4. He wisely refused my offer to play him Heads-Up for his
whole million dollars.

\section{Reading this book}

I've arranged this book so it can be read from start to finish, but jump
around between sections if that works better for you. It's your book too.
Sections II and III, ``Playing your hand'' and ``Essential Skills'' form
the bulk of the playing advice, so make sure you read those, together
with ``Putting players on a hand'', which I've put just after the
Dealing chapter, as the skills I teach in hand reading are related
to good dealing skills.

\section{What you won't find in the book}

This book is all about how to play No Limit Texas Holdem Fast
Tournaments in a non-Casino, Pubs-and-Clubs setting. There's one or
two ideas from Cash poker, Fixed Limit poker and Online poker in the
book, and a tiny bit of Omaha and the tiniest bit of Seven Card Stud.
But this is \textbf{not} a book about how to play poker online, or how
to play Cash poker or Omaha or Stud.

There's no advice given on Tournament Direction or how to run Home
Games. This is a book for pub poker players, written by a pub poker
player.

Or perhaps an ex-player. I mostly play Cash Pot Limit Omaha these days;
a thrilling action game where you can win or lose hundred of dollars
in three minutes, compared to a Poker Tournament where you lose most of
the time and only occasionally make a big score. Pot Limit Omaha
is like Crystal Meth compared to No Limit Texas Holdem's Cigarette
Smoking. Don't smoke and stay well away from Ice, but give Omaha a go
sometime.

I've got big Omaha games on Friday nights, Saturday nights and Sunday
nights so even without a pub poker game I still get about twenty hours
of poker action a week.


\section{Acknowledgements}

I've written this book entirely on my own and self-published it, so I don't
have too many people to thank. I did my own proofreading, so any mistakes
are certainly mine.

A lot of my early pub poker was at the legendary \textbf{Jade Tavern},
which for years had a day and night commitment to poker.
It was a great venue to play in, largely because of the enthusiasm
of \textbf{Paul Walker}. Sadly Jade is no longer operating and
its loss is still keenly felt. The premises is now a Karaoke bar.

Among my poker friends I'll single out \textbf{Simon Rea} for his friendship,
encouragement and continuing help in my poker career.

Lastly, \textbf{Al Markarian} did a super job in producing Australian
Poker Weekly, which ran every single week for two and a half years
until Online Poker's Black Friday. It was a pleasure to write for
it. I've re-used one of my APW articles as a chapter in this book.

\section{Writing this book}

If you think \textit{playing} poker is hard (and it is) then you should try
\textit{writing} a poker book; which is about four times harder
again. This book nearly drove me mad; I've written other books before
and this one has been by far the hardest book to write, to proofread
and to finish. I'm very satisfied that this book is finished. I've
enjoyed working on the book, and it's helped my game a lot and I'm
proud of the result.

A lot of the final work on the book was done during the 2020
Coronavirus COVID-19 shutdown, when nobody could play pub poker,
Casino poker or even home game poker. With a lot of time on my hands,
working on the book was a good reminder of happier poker times. The
COVID-19 shutdown was the worst Bad Beat I've ever seen in poker.

This was a hard book to stop writing. I'm always working on my game
and coming up with new ideas to use in my poker, both from experience
at the tables and from reading books and the Internet. However the
information in this book is complete and well worth
publishing. If I come up with many more new poker ideas I'll write
a second book.

I probably spend an hour studying poker for each tournament I play.
You might not have as much time to study poker as I do, but you'll
find like most things in life the more work you put in, the
more you'll get out of it.

Good luck at the tables.

% FIXME: about the author section??
\section{Dedication}

This book is dedicated to the memory my father,
Michael Douglas Cooper (1933-2017). Mike Cooper was an excellent
sportsman, in cricket, golf and rugby league. He played home game
poker with his business mates a few times a year, and kept his results
private. He lived the last fifteen years of his life in Tasmania and
we used to send each other birthday and christmas money cheques in the
mail. In one of his last letters to me he sent me a cheque for \$200,
which was double the \$100 cheque I'd sent him weeks earlier. He wrote
``I see your \$100 and raise you another \$100 ... ahhh those were the
nights!''.

\section{Exercises}

% FINALFIXME: Check the number of exercises is 20

There are 20 Exercises in this book, scattered at the end of some of
the chapters. Have a go at them using a pen and notepaper. There's no
passing or failing, they just test your understanding of the
material. All of the answers are provided at the back. Some of the
exercises need you to search on Google or YouTube, if you don't know
the answers already. A few need Maths and some needs a calculator. The
Exercises are numbered by their chapter.

\arabic{chapter}.1 (Google search) Which poker player won the World
Series Main Event in the 1980s, recovering from having just one chip
left, which led to the phrase that all you need to win a Poker
Tournament is ``a Chip and a Chair''?
