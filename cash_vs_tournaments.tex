\chapter{Cash versus Tournaments}

Some of you will be No Limit Holdem Cash players as well. I'm mostly
an Omaha Cash player these days, but still enjoy Tournaments; indeed I
enjoy Tournaments a lot more. This chapter is a bullet-list of
differences between Cash Poker and Tournament poker. To make the
discussion simple, I'm considering a Freezeout Poker Tournament with
no rebuys, lifelines or add-ons. The cash game is a \$2/\$3 game at
Star City Casino, with a buyin range of \$200 to \$500.

\section{Tournament poker}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Fixed buyin, which you lose almost all of the time. This entry
    fee is your maximum loss for your poker today.
  \item Small payoff some of the time, for a lot of hard
    work. Sometimes you get a huge disappointment if you make a bit of
    money but you're bad-beated out of huge money.
  \item Massive payoff if you win the tournament; sometimes 30 x your
    buyin amount.
  \item You play until you lose all of your chips.
  \item There's a one-off rake on your fixed buyin.
  \item Many books on Poker Tournaments
  \item Easy to find games
\end{itemize}

\section{Cash poker}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Win and lose real money from your first hand. You're already
    at a final table.
  \item You can change tables if your table is tough.
  \item You can leave at any time. Making the right leaving decision
    is one of the key skills of Cash Poker.
  \item Huge losses on a bad night
  \item Tough regular opponents
  \item Set your own hours, play when it's convenient for you.
  \item Paying about \$40/hour rake.
  \item Huge deepstacks of 100 Big Blinds or more. Often the money in
    the pot doesn't matter as much as the remaining money in a
    player's stack. Blind stealing is not important.
  \item Not many good books on Cash poker.
  \item Only legal raked Live Cash Poker game is at Star City Casino.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tournament poker is more fun}

Because you learn through experience that you normally lose your whole
buyin, you go into a Tournament with low expectations but the dream of
a big payout. I've had a lot of fun at Tournaments where I haven't
cashed. I've rarely enjoyed a Cash session where I haven't come out
well in front. Tournaments have a much better Risk/Reward payoff; your
risk is your affordable buyin money and the first prize money is
huge. In Cash you sometimes have a good night where your first buyin
of \$200 gets you to \$1900 but there's plenty of times when the
numbers are the other way around and you waste \$1500 or more.

No Limit Holdem is an excellent Tournament game and not as much fun as
a Cash game (but still OK). Pot Limit Omaha is an excellent Cash game
but not a very good Tournament game. Fixed Limit Holdem is an
excellent Cash game and a good Tournament game.
