Some of you will be No Limit Holdem cash game players as well. I'm
mostly an Omaha cash player these days, but still enjoy tournaments. I
find tournaments a lot more relaxing and fun compared to the grind of
trying to make money in cash games.

Here are two bullet-point lists about tournament poker and cash
poker. I'm comparing a \$110 freezeout poker tournament with The Star
Casino's \$2/\$3 No Limit Holdem cash game.

% The lists match up; for example the eighth bullet
% point is about how much rake you pay in each format.

% FIXME: Use a numbered list so the equivalences are obvious.

\section{In tournament poker...}

\begin{itemize}
  \item You have to play for at least three hours before you make any money.
  \item There's a fixed buyin, your maximum loss for tonight's poker.
  \item Horrible final table bad beats that cost you big payouts.
  \item Massive payoff if you win the tournament; 15 to 20 times your
    buyin amount.
  \item You must keep playing until you lose all of your chips. To win
    the most money you have to be the latest finisher.
  \item You can't choose your table or your seating position.
  \item You have to commit a few hours to play the tournament.
  \item There's a one-off rake on your fixed buyin.
  \item Big blinds late in the game means short-term card luck is crucial.
  \item You can find many books on how to play tournaments.
  \item You can easily find games any night across Sydney.
  \item Everyone starts with the same stack at the same time.
  \item There are big 5-handed, 4-handed, 3-handed and heads-up hands
    at the end.
\end{itemize}

\section{In Cash poker...}

\begin{itemize}
  \item You win and lose real money from your first hand. You're already
    at a final table.
  \item You have to control your money, and not lose big on your bad nights.
  \item You can double your first buyin money in the first two rounds.
  \item You suffer huge losses on a bad night or a 10-15x win on a great night.
  \item You can start and finish at any time. If you can't make a
    7:30pm tournament, play cash at 11pm. Making the right leaving
    decision is a crucial skill. There is no latest finisher, the game
    continues without you after you leave.
  \item You can change tables if your table is tough.
  \item You set your own hours, play when it's convenient for you.
  \item You're paying about \$40/hour rake.
  \item There are huge deepstacks of 100 Big Blinds or more. The money
    in the pot preflop doesn't matter as much as the remaining money
    in a player's stack. Blind stealing is not important.
  \item There are not many good books to teach you cash poker.
  \item The only legal raked game in New South Wales is at The Star Casino.
  \item Some players have huge stacks as you join the table.
  \item Every hand is dealt to 6 or more players.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tournament poker is more fun}

Because you learn that you normally lose your whole
buyin, you go into a tournament with low expectations but the dream of
a big jackpot payout. I've had a lot of fun at tournaments where I haven't
cashed. I like meeting poker players at tournaments and talking
to them before the game and in breaks. I don't have the same fun
at the cash tables where nobody's in a chatty mood and there are
no breaks. I've rarely enjoyed a cash session where I haven't come out
well in front. Tournaments have a much better Risk/Reward payoff; your
risk is your affordable buyin money and the first prize money is
huge. In cash I sometimes have a good night where my first buyin
of \$200 gets me to \$1900 but there's plenty of times when the
numbers are the other way around and I've lost \$1500 or more.

No Limit Holdem is an excellent tournament game and not as much fun as
a cash game (but still OK). Pot Limit Omaha is a very fun cash game
but not as good a tournament game.
