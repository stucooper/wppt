\chapter{Cash versus Tournaments}

Some of you will be No Limit Holdem Cash players as well. I'm mostly
an Omaha Cash player these days, but still enjoy Tournaments; indeed
Tournaments are a lot more relaxing and fun compared to the grind of
trying to make money in Cash.

Here are two bullet-point lists about Tournament Poker and Cash
Poker. I'm comparing a \$110 Freezeout Poker Tournament with Star City
Casino's \$2/\$3 No Limit Holdem Cash game, which has a buyin range of
\$200 to \$500. The lists match up; for example the eighth bullet
point is about how much rake you pay in each format.

\section{Tournament poker}

\begin{itemize}
  \item You have to play for at least two hours before you make any money.
  \item Fixed buyin, which you lose almost all of the time. This entry
    fee is your maximum loss for your poker today.
  \item Small payoff some of the time, for a lot of hard
    work. Sometimes you get a huge disappointment if you make a bit of
    money but you're bad-beated out of huge money.
  \item Massive payoff if you win the tournament; sometimes 30 x your
    buyin amount.
  \item You must play until you lose all of your chips.
  \item You can't choose your table or your seating position.
  \item You have to commit a few hours to play the tournament.
  \item There's a one-off rake on your fixed buyin.
  \item The blinds get big and short-term card luck late in the
    tournament plays a big part.
  \item Many books on Poker Tournaments.
  \item Easy to find games.
  \item Everyone starts with the same stack, it's a level playing field.
\end{itemize}

\section{Cash poker}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Win and lose real money from your first hand. You're already
    at a final table.
  \item You have to control your money, and know what you hope to win
    tonight and how much you can afford to lose.
  \item You can double your first buyin money in the first two rounds.
  \item Huge losses on a bad night. A 10x to 15x win on a great night.
  \item You can leave at any time. Making the right leaving decision
    is one of the key skills of Cash Poker.
  \item You can change tables if your table is tough.
  \item Set your own hours, play when it's convenient for you.
  \item Paying about \$40/hour rake.
  \item Huge deepstacks of 100 Big Blinds or more. Often the money in
    the pot doesn't matter as much as the remaining money in a
    player's stack. Blind stealing is not important.
  \item Not many good books on Cash poker.
  \item Only legal raked Live Cash Poker game is at Star City Casino.
  \item Some players have huge stacks as you join the table.
\end{itemize}

\section{Tournament poker is more fun}

Because you learn through experience that you normally lose your whole
buyin, you go into a Tournament with low expectations but the dream of
a big Jackpot payout. I've had a lot of fun at Tournaments where I haven't
cashed. I like meeting good poker players at tournaments and talking
to them before the game and in breaks, I don't like it so much when
they're at the cash tables and nobody's in a chatty mood and there are
no breaks. I've rarely enjoyed a Cash session where I haven't come out
well in front. Tournaments have a much better Risk/Reward payoff; your
risk is your affordable buyin money and the first prize money is
huge. In Cash you sometimes have a good night where your first buyin
of \$200 gets you to \$1900 but there's plenty of times when the
numbers are the other way around and you waste \$1500 or more.

No Limit Holdem is an excellent Tournament game and not as much fun as
a Cash game (but still OK). Pot Limit Omaha is an excellent Cash game
but not a very good Tournament game. Fixed Limit Holdem is an
excellent Cash game and a good Tournament game.
