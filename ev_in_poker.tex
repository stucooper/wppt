\chapter{Expected Value in Poker}

The last two chapters have been a thorough look at two key ideas in
poker; expected value and counting outs. Now we're going to marry
those concepts together and see how to use them in your betting
decisions. First, a look at a Poker game where you fold, check, bet,
call and raise, but by a fixed amount each time: Fixed Limit Holdem.

\section{Fixed Limit Holdem}

I grew up with Fixed Limit and still love it. Nobody wants to play it
anymore in Australia. In my early days of Poker I played a few days of
Fixed Limit at the famous Bay 101 Casino in San Jose, Silicon Valley,
California. I often daydream about playing there again (it's moved a
few miles since the time I played there in 2000, but I'll be able to
find it.)

In Fixed Limit you often get many bets and calls in the pot by the
turnstreet. In a \$10/\$20 game, there's often \$140 in the pot with
one card to come. The betting amount by now is a fixed \$20 but that's
the highest amount you can bet. Let's look at the EV for the Leader,
with top two pair, betting against a Chaser who has a Flush Draw.
