\chapter{Types of Pub Tournaments}

% Last updated: 20190201

Even in the field of No Limit Holdem Poker Tournaments,
with blinds increasing after a fixed amount of time, there's still a
lot of variety in tournament conditions. This chapter
looks at the different types of Pub Poker No Limit Holdem Tournaments
and different arrangements players make to get money above and
beyond the traditional first/second/third/minors prizepool.

\section{Freezeouts}

A traditional No Limit Holdem Tournament is called a \textbf{Freezeout}.
There's a single, one-off entry fee, which is the most you'll have to
spend to play in this tournament. This is what your Mum and Dad
think a poker tournament is. Everyone starts with the same number
of chips, although in many Pub tournaments there are Niggles which
I'll cover shortly, that stop the tournament from being a proper
level playing field. The players compete for the
money in the Prizepool and the top 10\% + 1 of the field win money.

Freezout example: 30 players enter a \$22 tournament with a \$500
guarantee. \$20 of each buyin goes into the prizepool, making for a \$600
prizepool tonight. Tonight there are 4 prizes paid: \\
First place: \$280 \\
Second     : \$180 \\
Third      : \$100 \\
Fourth     :  \$40  \\

% FIXME: Better LaTeX lining up of the lines above

Notice that the gap in prizemoney goes up as you climb the ladder
from bottom to top. Third gets \$60 more than Fourth, but Second gets
\$80 more than Third. And First gets \$100 more than Second. This is
typical of how a payout structure works.

First place pays a bit under 50\% of the prizepool. In a
big field, with a lot more players to be paid, first place can
be as low as 30\% of the total prizemoney, in a smaller game with
fewer people to be paid, First can be as high as 45\%.

\subsection{Niggles}

There are some Niggles in many Pub Poker Tournaments that operators
have introduced, that make even a simple Freezeout an
uneven playing field. Here are the four main ones I've come across.


\begin{description}

\item[Spend Cards] Many venues encourage players to buy beer and food there.
When you register you get given a card that you get stamped when you
buy beer, double-stamped when you order a meal and if you collect four
stamps on your card you exchange it after the first break for extra
tournament chips, often a 5,000 chip for a 20,000 stack tournament.

I hate spend cards. If a Pub's got good beer or food
I'll spend my money there on the basis of value-for-money, I don't
want to be co-erced into it for the sake of getting more Tournament Chips!

Poker players are notoriously tight spenders of money.
Many don't drink during a game because that affects their concentration.
There's not much in it for a venue having a bunch of people using
their floorspace if they're not eating, drinking and spending like
the other patrons. Spend cards encourage this.

Pubs can get in a lot of trouble if they've been found to be
promoting extra drinking. Happy hour is just about the only
promotion allowed. Spend cards could be seen to be encouraging drinking
and if someone was involved in a drunk incident that went
to court they could well have grounds to blame a venue for
promoting excess consumption of alcohol simply through poker
spend cards. This hasn't happened in Australia yet (to my knowledge)
but venues need to be very careful.

\item[Early Bird Bonus] A lot of tournaments advertise a Registration
time a full hour ahead of the start time. 6:30pm registration, 7:30pm
start; it sounds like a formal dinner with pre-dinner drinks served
before being seated. Some tournaments reward players for being
at the venue at least half an hour before the tournament start with extra
chips.

As everyone is seated for the first hand, the TD wanders around
giving an extra big value chip to the early-registered players. The
later players are now playing a 20,000 stack game against some
25,000 stacks and they're already behind without a card being dealt.

The Early Bird Bonus is a nice sneaky way to again encourage extra
spending by the players. You're at the pub, the tournament doesn't
start for a whole hour, what are you going to do? Ooooh there's poker
machines in that room. This is one of the most clever Niggles that
there is.

\item[Member's Discount] Membership discounts have been part
of food and drinks prices for years now, and the concept
is being extended at some places to midsized Poker buyins
(\$30-\$70). I've played in a tournament with the buyin
\$35 for members, \$40 for guests and another where it was \$50
for members and \$55 for guests. The second was promoted as ``10\%
discount for members'' but it's actually a 9\% discount for members
(they save \$5 off the \$55 guest price, which is a one-eleventh saving)
or a 10\% surcharge for guests (they pay an extra \$5 on top of the
Member's \$50 price, a 10\% surcharge).

Member's Discount doesn't bother me too much, though the
cynic in me believes that any guest surcharge money
goes straight into the oragnisers pocket and not the prizepool.

\item[Must-be-a-Member of the Club] Some venues (in my experience,
really big RSL clubs) enforce that you need to be a member of the Club
to play in their Poker tournaments. In 2018 I turned up for a \$55
tournament a long drive from home to find that I needed to also cough
up \$20 for a club membership, at a place I have no interest in visiting
more than once a year. Of course I only found this out at registration
time.

This seems highly unethical to me. I bet there's no RSL club that
restricts Poker machines to paid-up Members, but some do it for
their Poker tournaments. Sure you have to be a member to use
their gym and their snooker tables, but just to play
in a poker tournament??

Naturally the normal New South Wales Five Kilometre
exclusion circle applies to registered clubs, which are
typically any place with poker machines that isn't an out-and-out pub.
RSL Clubs, Leagues Clubs and Bowling Clubs all have this 5 kilometre
exclusion circle.

Summary of Niggles:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
NAME    &  FREQUENCY  & PAIN FACTOR\\ \hline
Spend Cards & Common  & 8/10\\ \hline
Early Birds & Occasional & 5/10\\ \hline
Member's Discount & Rare  & 3/10\\ \hline
Must be a Member & Rare  & 9/10\\ \hline
\end{tabular}

There's bound to be other Niggles I haven't come across yet,
especially in the Freeroll world where a venue is putting up the
prizemoney and they feel more than ever that they have the right
to some return from the players. I have a recurring
nightmare that right now some Poker organisers are meeting and
coming up with devilish new Niggles to hit us with.

\section{Rebuys, Lifelines and Add-ons}

A rebuy\footnote{Geeky writer's note: Rebuy is now such a common word in
poker that it has lost its hyphen. I spelled it re-buy for years but
now it is simply rebuy. Buyin also lost a hyphen.  Add-on still has it}
is typically a second chance, pay-the-tournament-buyin-again
option that a player can use if he busts out in the early rounds
(typically, before the first break). Some tournaments call this a
\textbf{Lifeline} which is a great name for it.

Sometimes multiple rebuys are allowed, though most Pub tournaments
with a rebuy use the simpler single Lifeline rebuy. Most Pub
tournaments require you to be completely out of chips before you
rebuy. Ask the Tournament Director when you register what
the rebuy conditions are.

Casinos sometimes use rebuy tournaments as daytime entertainment
before their big tournament series, sometimes free entry events
but with very short stacks and multiple rebuys allowed. A correct
strategy for this tournament can be for players at the table
to rebuy as often as possible; so when the rebuy period ends there's
a lot of chips at that table and the players from that table will
have mountains of chips when tables merge and they get moved to
other tables. You won't find tournaments like this in the Pub Poker
environment.

If you're playing a tournament with a lifeline, you can change
your early level strategy and take extra chances on early
double ups, knowing that if you bust out your night isn't over and
you can buy a second shot at the tournament. You can bet and raise
on your flush draws and straight draws much more aggressively.

Some tournaments give you a special non-playing ``lifeline chip'',
which must be surrendered (together with the rebuy money) when you
make your rebuy. This is a convenient way for the Tournament
Director to make sure players rebuy only once, and to track the number
of rebuys made.

An \textbf{Add-on} is a final, last ``buy tournament chips with cash''
option. During the last significant break, players still
in the tournament can make one final chip purchase. You should get
quite a lot of chips for your add-on; often equal to the tournament
starting stack.

Add-ons might look like Spend Cards where you're not even
getting any food or drink for your chips, but there are important
differences. The money from your Add-on is going into the Tournament
Prizepool, not the venue's profit. You get a lot more chips for
the price of your Add-on. They are transparently part of the
Tournament conditions which you will be aware of when you register.

You should always take the Add-on. Factor that into your expectations
at the start of the night; if you're playing a \$15 game with a \$10
rebuy and a \$10 add-on, expect this tournament to cost you the full
\$35 and at least \$25. You'll save a fraction of money if you don't
need the lifeline, but \textbf{always} take the add-on.

You might dream in the early levels that you're going so well
tonight and you're so far in front that you can save yourself
the cost of the add-on; that's bad thinking and you should always
invest in the extra chips. Other players will be buying the add-on
as well; so you need those add-on chips to stay in front.

Even if you've got 20,000 chips and everyone else has 5,000 chips at
your table, you should still take a 5,000 chip add-on so you're staying
as far ahead as you can. After the break you'll have a 2.5 to 1 chip
advantage (25k to 10k) compared to a 2 to 1 chip advantage (20k to 10k).
If this game was a freezeout you'd keep your 4 to 1 chip advantage
(20k to 5k) but sadly anyone who adds on has just caught up a lot to you
without even having to win a pot.

\subsection*{Trustworthy Tournament Directors}

In rebuy and add-on games, there's extra cash being taken by
the Tournament Directors after the initial buyin. You want
a trustworthy TD and a high confidence that this extra cash is
going into the prizepool. You can count the number of players
at the start of a tournament and know pretty well what the prizepool
will be in a straight Freezeout, but in a Rebuy/Add-on tournament
you can't keep track of how many of those players rebought and how
many Added on. A really well-run tournament will display this
information on the tournament clock screen; a badly run tournament
will have you worried that the TD is on the take.

\section{Bounty Chips}

A Bounty Tournament is a tournament with a traditional prizepool
plus a secondary prizepool of Bounties. The bounty
is a small prize you get when you knock a player out.
Each player gets a non-playing special Bounty chip.
When you knock a player out, he gives you his bounty chip.
He himself cashes out any bounty chips he's won from knocking
other people out earlier in the tournament. Each bounty chip is worth
some small, fun amount like \$5 and it's a little extra work for the
Tournament Director cashing them in for busted players.

One minor annoyance of Bounties is when you win a massive pot
from a player, crippling him, but he had a few more chips than
you and stays on in the tournament, and immediately loses the
next hand to someone else and that third player gets the
Bounty chip. You've got all his tournament chips, but someone
else gets his cash bounty chip. Sigh.

One good thing about Bounties is there is less ``checking it down''
from active players against an all-in player; because the active
players are in competition to try to win the all-in player's
Bounty chip even if the tournament chip amount of the all-in player
isn't much.

I like Bounties, though the field size needs to be 40 or more to
make them worthwhile. A \$27 game of \$20 prizepool, \$5 bounty
and \$2 rake is a nicely priced game.

\section{Bounty Players}

Some tournaments designate a player or small group of players
to be the Bounty Players for that night; if one of them wins
the tournament they will score an extra jackpot on top of
the prize money involved. This adds a lucky draw element to
poker and adds extra excitement to the Bounty Players chosen.

The Tournament Director announces who the night's bounty players
are soon after the tournament begins. It's never been me.

\section{Bounty Knockouts}

I haven't played in a tournament with a Bounty Knockout but I
mention it here for completeness. A Bounty Knockout is a price
put on a player's head, if you knock that particular player out
you get a prize, on top of his remaining chips. It's like a
Bounty Chip Tournament but only a few particular players not
everyone in the field. The Bounty Knockout player could be the
winner from the previous week, or one of the regulars chosen
by the TD, or randomly chosen from the field.

\section{Last Longer Bet}

A Last Longer Bet is a side arrangement between a few regulars
where they put in extra money and the player
in that bet who lasts longest in the tournament gets that extra
money, winner takes all. It's like a tournament inside a tournament.
Some good Tournament Directors I've seen
will run the Last Longer Bet for the players.

I'll normally take part in a Last Longer Bet if I know there's one
going. They can be bunch-of-mates arrangements and
they don't have to let me in on it if they don't want to.

\section{Swaps}

A Swap is a private arrangement between two people where they
agree to share part of the prizemoney with each other should
either make money tonight. I've done swaps of 10\% with a mate and
I've done well out of them too; once he paid me
\$150 after he won \$1500 in a tournament and another time
he refused a 10\% swap offer from me in a tournament I won \$2000
in.\footnote{He'd just done a swap with another mate so he had enough
swap action already, otherwise he would have taken my swap}

Keep your swaps private and don't swap more than 20\% of your action.
Swap an even amount with your friend. (5\% for 5\%, 10\% for 10\%).
If you think he's a bad player and he'll never win and
you'll sometimes win, don't swap with him to begin with.

If you're in a swap and you make it to the big money, discuss
with your swapper before you do any prizemoney splits. He's
getting part of your money tonight and wants you to win as
much as possible.

Only do swap deals when there's genuinely big prize money involved.
I never think about Swaps unless first prize is at least \$500.

In January 2019 I was deep (30 left of 125 starters) in a game with
a first prize of about \$4000 in a game I'd swapped 40\% of my action.
That was an exciting game for me and my backer, sadly I finished
27th.

\section{Guarantees}

Some tournaments are now offering a minimum guaranteed prizepool. You
don't want to go out of your way to a \$22 poker tournament on the
other side of town, get there and find out that there's 4 players tonight
and first prize is \$50 and second prize is \$30. You'd rather have
done something else with your time than go to a nothing Holdem Tournament.

Guarantees protect a player against this disappointment. A venue
advertising a guarantee for a game will make up the shortfall if the
player buyins don't cover the guarantee. Our four players of a \$22
poker tournament with a \$500 guarantee could be playing for prizes
of \$250, \$150 and \$100 even though it's only cost them \$22 each.

Naturally venues won't be happy making up shortfalls like this and
their guarantee will usually be comfortably covered by player numbers.

Some places try to weasel out of their guarantees on quiet nights.
The APL website has this disclaimer on their listed guarantees:
``Any Guarantees listed above are indicative only and all effort
is made to ensure that they are correct. APL/888PL will not cover
any guarantee listed incorrectly, please check with your local
host or venue to confirm the guarantee if your decision to
play is based solely on the guarantee.''

\section{Tuesday night Pub Poker}

Here's a listing of Sydney games in the National Poker League
for a Tuesday night in October, 2018. It should give you an
idea of the choice available and the different options available.
Of the 11 games, only 5 of them were classical Freezeouts.
I don't know which Niggles applied at any of the games.


\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline
Suburb & Buyin & Rebuy/AddOn & Guarantee \\ \hline
Fairfield        & \$25 & \$25+\$50 & NONE \\ \hline
Hoxton Park       & \$10 & \$10+\$10 & \$500 \\ \hline
George Street CBD & \$20 & FREEZEOUT & \$400 \\ \hline
Chester Hill & Free & \$10+\$20 & \$500 \\ \hline
Collaroy & \$25 & FREEZEOUT & NONE \\ \hline
Guildford & \$28 & FREEZEOUT & \$1000 \\ \hline
Windsor & \$22 & FREEZEOUT & \$500 \\ \hline
Seven Hills & \$20 & \$10 rebuy & \$500 \\ \hline
Hurstville & \$15 & \$10+\$10 & \$1200 \\ \hline
Dundas & \$6 & FREEZEOUT & \$500 \\ \hline
Pennant Hills & \$8 & \$10+\$10 & \$500 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

A good range of games there, that shows how much option you
have even for just the National Poker League on a Tuesday night.
I don't like the look of the Fairfield Add-on being priced at \$50
so I doubt I'll go to that game. The big Guildford guarantee looks
good, so does the Hurstville one.

There's not much variation in start time; the games all started
at 7:30pm and the bigger games had late buyin up until 9:00pm.

\section{Raked cash games outside the Casino are illegal}

In the APW era, there was a popular
cash-game-in-disguise format that some venues ran
called ``Chip Chops'', or ``Timed Tournaments''.
You got chips to the value of
your buyin, the blinds never went up and after a fixed
amount of time the tournament was declared over and
everyone got cash back to the value of their chips.

Rake wasn't taken out of each pot, but it was on each buyin.
It cost you \$22 to get \$20 worth of chips, \$55 to get
\$50 in chips and so on. The small chip chops had blinds of
50 cents/1 dollar and the bigger chip chops had blinds of
1 dollar/2 dollars. Most chip chops went for 90 minutes,
sometimes the big chip chops went for 2 hours.

Just about the only practical difference between a
Chip Chop and a real cash game is that in a real Cash game
you can cash out early; you can if you like play one hand,
triple up and make it a very early night and cash out.
You can't do that in a Chip Chop, you have to sit through
the whole length of the tournament before you could get your money.

Busted players can rebuy or simply not rejoin the tournament,
at their choice.

This practise was put to an end by the NSW Office of Liquor,
Gaming and Racing (``OLGR''), probably at the instigation of The Star Casino,
who pay a lot of money to the State Government to
have an exclusive live cash poker license in New South Wales.

Here's an excerpt of an article I wrote in 2011 in APW called
``The Death of Chip Chops''

% FIXME: some nice cartouchey kind of thing showing this is a 2011 excerpt

I've got the email from OLGR, I'm not a lawyer but it looks watertight
to me. There's penalties of \$5,500 for a first offence and \$11,000 for
subsequent offences on the organisers of Chip Chop tournaments and
\$5,500 penalties for the players. I doubt there'll be any Chip Chop
juicy enough for players or organisers to risk a game. It'll be back
to home games and backroom clubs from now on.

The OLGR describle a Chip Chop as a game where players exchange chips for
cash at the expiry of the tournament and any of the following three
events occur: (a) operator or venue takes portion of entry fee
(b) non-playing dealer or (c) entry fee to venue charged.

% FIXME: end the cartouchey thing

The \$55 for \$50 in chips obviously meets the ``operator or venue takes
portion of entry fee'' stipulation.

In 2018 the OLGR has been renamed to simply
``Liquor and Gaming NSW'', which is either one of those meaningless
name changes that Governments love, or else Racing has been spun off.

The language is simpler than in 2011, you need to find
the PDF document ``Fact Sheet FS3001: Poker Tournaments'' from
the website https://www.liquorandgaming.nsw.gov.au.

Paraphasing slightly to keep this excerpt to less than four paragraphs,
FS3001 says ``As the chips in a Chip-Chop tournament
have monetary value, the game is being played for stakes. As a result,
the game would be unlawful if (a) the dealer is not a participant in the game
(b) a person other than a participant in the game receives a payment
or benefit from the playing of the game (c) a payment is made for the
right to participate in the game or to enter premises where the game
is played''

The scary fines are the same as they were in 2011, and now there's even
the risk of Jail time! Organisers risk 2 years imprisonment and
participants risk 12 months.

The 2011 version of this book had a nice chapter on Chip Chops and
Chip Chop Strategy, which I've taken out. They are illegal and I
won't condone breaking the law.

None of this book is about Online Poker, but while I'm at it,
let me remind you that playing Poker online from Australia
\textbf{is also illegal}.

\section{Should Pub Poker be regulated?}

No. Philosophically and politically I'm against Nanny State
Government over-regulation. Though neither should Pub Poker
be a Wild West free-for-all where operators subtly rip the players
off. Normally in regulation situations I prefer a ``Code of Conduct''
where competing operators agree on principles and police each other,
rather than heavy-handed Governement intervention. This works well
in the Media industry.

In the world of Poker, the Poker Tournament Director's Association
is a great example of an industry body that improves the integrity
of the game. A similar initiative in the Australian Pub Poker scene
would do a lot towards ironing out occasional problems such as
inconsistent rulings, non-payment of guarantees and other quibbles
that arise from time to time. And if they could get rid of Spend Cards
while they're at it, the game will be even better.
