\section{Old Poker Sayings}

In the comic strip ``The Phantom'', the legend of The Phantom is
spread by forest dwellers through a series of Old Jungle Sayings.
``When the Phantom strikes, lightning stands still'' is one example.
In the same manner, here's a list of Old Poker Sayings, which contain
a lot of wisdom which you will do well to heed.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Poker is a battle between a made hand and a drawing hand
  \item Beware of the Speech
  \item To win a poker tournament you have to win with Ace-King and win
    against Ace-King
  \item You can't bluff a bluffer
  \item Nobody bluffs a made hand
  \item Every hand's a winner and every hand's a loser
  \item Big Blind Special
  \item Never trust a poker player
  \item Send it!
  \item It's easier to bet all-in than it is to call all-in
  \item Poker is war disguised as cards
\end{itemize}

You might know some more Old Poker Sayings that belong in this list;
email me any you think I'm missing and I'll add them to the next
edition. There's always room for more Old Poker Sayings.

One famous US Presidential saying is actually a poker saying!
US President Harry S. Truman was fond of ``The Buck Stops Here'' and
had it made into a sign on the White House desk. The Buck in
this saying isn't the almighty dollar, it's the dealer button. When
you move the dealer button, you're ``passing the buck'' which became a
metaphor for shifting responsibility to the next guy. As the US
President, Truman had no-one higher in the chain of command to pass
problems up to. The Buck stops here.

If you're paying close attention you might notice that I snuck in
Send it! as an Old Poker Saying. It is. I've been using it for at
least fifteen years. If you're going to make it in the big Sydney
games, you'll be hearing it a lot.
