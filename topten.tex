One famous US Presidential sayings is actually a poker saying!
US President Harry S. Truman was fond of ``The Buck Stops Here'' and
had it made into a sign he had on the White House desk. The Buck in
this saying isn't the almighty dollar, it's the dealer button. When
you move the dealer button, you're ``passing the buck'' which became a
metaphor for shifting responsibility to the next guy. As the US
President, Truman had no-one higher in the chain of command to pass
problems up to. The Buck stops here.
