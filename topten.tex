Here are my top ten rules for poker, which I'll return to
a few times in this book. Keep them in mind as you read.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Win big, lose small
  \item Play tight/aggressive poker
  \item Make position plays
  \item Look for tells and follow the action
  \item Size your bets well
  \item Don't slowplay
  \item Raise to find out where you're at
  \item Treat the game seriously
  \item Know the structure
  \item Enjoy your poker
\end{itemize}
