\chapter{The Pub Poker Price}

% Last updated: 20181018

By playing casual poker outside a Casino environment, you come across
weaker players, but also frustrations that come with playing
poker in these settings. Here's a list of gripes I've had at Pub
games over the years. I call these problems ``The Pub Poker Price''.
Things that really annoy me in Pub Poker are

\begin{itemize}

\item Bad shuffling and dealing. Especially dealers who don't
put a preflop exposed card back on top of the deck, and end
up wrongly burning a second card at flop time

\item Drunk players who never know when the action is on them and
never follow the action. Often these guys catch lucky for a while
and have a whole bunch of chips to annoy me with.

\item Any local rulings that are different to what I expect.

\item Players who show other players their hands before they fold

\item 12 hands in an hour.

\item Players who discuss active hands and assist other players in
calling or folding to your river bets. I always say ``one
player to a hand'' and try and stop the mates helping each other
out in this ``friendly'' game. Any venue whose tournament directors
allow this and don't discourage it even after you've brought
it to their attention is not worth playing at again.

\item People who think it's funny to call out the wrong hands on the river.

\item Bonus drink cards, where people are encouraged to purchase 4 drinks,
get their card stamped for each drink they buy, and then receive extra
chips in the poker game after the first break.

This was one of my Niggles from an earlier chapter, but I'm so annoyed
by it that I'm whinging about it a second time.

\item Capricious blind increases so the tournament will finish soon.

\item Players taking their own change from the pot and getting it wrong.

\end{itemize}

On a positive note I've
had hundreds of hours of great entertainment at pub poker. I've
met some wonderful smart people at the tables who I've enjoyed playing
against a lot. Pub poker is a lot friendlier, more social, more affordable
and more accessible than poker at the Casino.

You'll have your own poker gripes and poker players love to complain
so here's a list of blank bullet points for you to add your own
complaints. Get out a pen and add your top five below, and add extra
bullets if you have more than five gripes. Some of the things you
really hate about pub poker are
