By playing poker outside a Casino environment, you come across
weaker players, but also frustrations that come with playing
in these settings. Here's a list of gripes I've had with Pub
games over the years. I call these gripes The Pub Poker Price.
Things that really annoy me in Pub Poker are

\begin{itemize}

\item Bad shuffling and dealing. Especially dealers who don't
put a preflop exposed card back on top of the deck, and end
up wrongly burning a second card at flop time.

\item Drunk players who never know when the action is on them and
never follow the action. Often these guys catch lucky for a while
and have a whole bunch of chips to annoy me with.

\item Any local rulings that are different to what I expect.

\item Players who show other players their hands before they fold.

\item 12 hands in an hour.

\item Players who discuss active hands and assist other players in
calling or folding to your river bets. I always say ``one
player to a hand'' and try and stop the mates helping each other
out in this ``friendly'' game. Any venue whose tournament directors
allow this and don't discourage it even after you've brought
it to their attention is not worth playing at again.

\item People who think it's funny to call out the wrong hands on the river.

\item Spend cards, where people are encouraged to purchase 4 drinks,
get their card stamped for each drink they buy, and then receive extra
chips in the poker game after the first break.

This was one of my Niggles from an earlier chapter, but I'm so annoyed
by it that I'm complaining about it a second time.

\item Additional blind increases so the tournament will finish soon.

\item Players taking their own change from the pot and getting it wrong.

\item Players who make all their bet sizes end in 75, in the early rounds
when the green chips are still in play. They'll bet 575, 1075, raise
to 1475 and nonsense like that. Keep the green chips for the blinds
and make your bets in multiples of 100 or at least 50.

\end{itemize}

On a positive note I've
had hundreds of hours of great entertainment at pub poker. I've
met some wonderful smart people at the tables who I've really enjoyed
playing against. Pub poker is a lot friendlier, more social, more
affordable and more accessible than Casino poker.

When I wrote for Australian Poker Weekly I was mostly supportive of
the venues I played in. There was one place I didn't like much, they
were in some of my articles but never identified by name. I played
there a few times because it was close to where I lived and the only
pub for miles. They used different poker operators on different nights
of the week; one was quite good but the others were awful.

You'll have your own poker gripes and poker players love to complain
so here's a list of blank bullet points for you to add your own
complaints. Get out a pen and add your top five below, and draw extra
bullets if you have more than five gripes. Some of the things you
really hate about pub poker are
