\chapter{A Short History of Poker}

An exhaustive study of poker's history is \citet{McManus}.

\section{The Games}

In Poker history there have been five major Poker games.
Poker was first played with a 20-card deck (AKQJT in four suits) and
four players were dealt a Five card hand and that was it. There were no
flushes or straights; the only hand to use the full five cards as a
Complete Hand was a Full House which is why it's called Full. In
20-card poker there was no ``high card'' hand either; AKQJT was the
only possible non-pair hand and any other hand beats it.

Poker got more interesting with a 52-card deck and the addition of
Flushes and Straights. The major poker games all use this standard
52-card deck. There have been five poker games: Five Card Draw, Five
Card Stud, Seven Card Stud, Texas Holdem and Omaha.

% FIXME: In Super System 1; there's discussion of Five Card Draw,
% Seven Card Stud and Holdem. By Super System 2 (2005) there's
% a chapter on a new Draw Game, 2-7 Triple Draw, traditional Stud High
% has disappeared (there's a chapter on Stud High-Low) and there's now
% a chapter on Omaha. Holdem is prominent in both books.

\subsection{Five Card Draw Poker}

Draw Poker was the poker game of the Wild West, the US Civil War and
the Mississippi River Paddle Steamer boats in the days of Mark Twain.
In Draw, players have five cards to themselves and they're
all private. Here's a player's final hand after the draw:
\back\back\back\back\back\ . If he drew one card in his draw,
he might've had two pair looking for a full house, four cards to a
flush, four cards to a straight, trips and he's only drawing one card
not two for deception, any kind of hand really.

You don't get to see any of the other cards in Draw Poker, so there's
not much information to go on.

Our main interest in Draw Poker today is in the odds of Five Card
hands. Holdem's community cards are a Five Card random hand, so poker
odds apply to the community (how often it will be a flush, how often
it will contain a pair and so on).

Movie: \textbf{The Sting} starring Paul Newman and Robert Redford.

\subsection{Five Card Stud}

In Five Card Stud, each player starts with a downcard and an upcard,
and after each betting round gets a new upcard, finishing with one
down, four up. Here's a heads up confrontation in Five Card Stud:
\back\nines\Qc\Jc\tred\ against \back\fourh\Jh\tend\trec\ . With
only five cards per player, the poker hands made are pretty boring;
high cards and single pairs are typically enough to win.

Five Card Stud was the main game played in the high stakes months-long
Heads Up confrontation in Las Vegas between Johnny Moss and Nick ``The
Greek'' Dandolos. The huge stakes of this game and other cash games
attracted onlookers to the casinos, which led to the initial World
Series of Poker. Moss was the WSOP Champion for the first two years.

In Five Card Stud, using your one Downcard and your four Upcards, you
can make 1 poker hand.

Movie: \textbf{The Cincinnatti Kid} starring Steve MacQueen and Edward G
Robinson. An extras feature on my DVD is a voiceover commentary from
Phil Gordon.

\subsection{Seven Card Stud}

Seven Card Stud is an extension of Five Card Stud. Each player starts
with two downcards and an upcard. After the next three betting rounds
each player gets a new upcard, then finally the seventh card is a
downcard and there's a final betting round. A final confrontation in
Seven Card Stud is \back\back\nines\Qd\Jd\tred\back\ against
\back\back\fourh\Jh\tend\trec\back\ . Seven Card Stud is a nice mix of
visible upcards and mysterious down cards. It's a great game and I
wish it was played a lot more in Australia.

% There was very briefly a game called Six Card Stud but it died out
% very quickly as Seven Card Stud grew in popularity.

In Seven Card Stud, using any of your three Downcards and four
Upcards, you can make 21 different Five-Card poker hands.

With so many possible poker hands, you can make a strong high
Five-Card hand and a trashy low card hand. One of the Stud games is
``Seven Card Stud Eight-or-Better'' where half the pot goes to the
best five card poker hand and half the pot goes to the worst five card
poker hand, provided it's five different cards all eight or lower.
Seven Card Stud played exclusively to make the lowest hand possible is
called Razz.

Movie: \textbf{Rounders} starring Matt Damon and Edward Norton.
What? Rounders is a Seven Card Stud movie?? It sure is. Apart from the
No Limit Holdem hands against Teddy KGB, and the Fixed Limit Holdem
hands at Atlantic City, all the hands you see in Rounders are Seven
Card Stud Hands. Mike and Worm beat the Trust Fund babies at Stud,
Worm cheats at Stud in Petra's club, Mike calls the hands at Stud in
the Judge's game and Mike and Worm get beaten up by the Police after
they catch Worm cheat-dealing at Stud.

Rounders is all about the East-Coast of the United States poker scene;
in New York and New Jersey. Seven Card Stud is a lot more
popular in the East of the USA than the West. Poker is illegal in
New York but legal in New Jersey which houses the gambling capital
Atlantic City. Some famous players to come from New York and the illegal
clubs there include Stu Ungar, Erik Seidel, Howard Lederer and Dan Harrington.

\subsection{Texas Holdem}

Holdem is a variation of Seven Card Stud. Instead of everyone
having Four unique upcards, Holdem uses Five shared upcards. In Seven
Card Stud you have to remember the upcards that other people
folded. In Holdem; all the upcards are shared and stay visible
throughout the hand. And with only two private cards each and five
shared cards, you make the Nuts quite often and you know that you've
made the nuts.

A final Holdem confrontation is
\back\back\nines\Qd\Jd\tres\fourc\ against
\back\back\nines\Qd\Jd\tres\fourc\ . Players share the same five
upcards, which is why they're called Community Cards.

In Texas Holdem you can make 21 different poker hands. Playing the
board is one poker hand. Using one of your hole cards and four from the
board (a Single-Card hand) can be done in ten ways. Using both your
hole cards and three from the board (a Double-Card hand) can be done
in ten different ways. So there are 21 different poker hands you can
make at a showdown in Holdem. This is the same as Seven Card
stud: in each game you're making a five card poker hand from a
group of seven cards.

Holdem can be played High/Low Eights-or-Better but almost never
is. With only two secret hole cards each, the game plays much better
as a High Hand game.

Movie: \textbf{Casino Royale} starring Daniel Craig. James Bond movies
capture the spirit of their time, and this reboot movie, the first
with Daniel Craig as 007, features some crazes of the first decade of
the 2000s: SMS text messaging, Parkour freerunning stunts and No Limit
Texas Holdem poker. Every hand of poker you see in Casino Royale is a
No Limit Holdem hand.

\subsubsection{You know what the Nuts is}

The great attraction of the information you have in Holdem is that you
can see what the Nuts is. If the Board doesn't have a pair, nobody can
have a full house. For someone to have a flush, the Board must have at
least Three of a suit, and a flush is only possible in one suit. For
someone to have a straight, the Board must have three cards in a
continuum of five. Holdem Players soon learn to read the Board and to
recognize what the nuts is at each phase.

A Holdem player whose whole cards are \Ad\tred\ knows he's the winner
in the showdown against another player's
\back\back\nines\Qd\Jd\tres\fourd\ . A stud player, looking at another
player showing \back\back\nines\Qd\Jd\tres\back\ doesn't know for
certain what the other player has; he could have a flush in diamonds,
a flush in spades, a straight, a full house or even Quads. Being able
to see what the Nuts is is one of the great features of Texas Holdem.

\subsection{Omaha}

I won't say too much about Omaha or I'll never stop, but it's the
fifth major poker game. It uses the same Community as
Holdem, with the same Flop, Turn and River. Like Holdem, you can see
what the nuts is at each Board phase. Each player gets Four hole
cards and must use Two and exactly Two of his hole cards in the
Showdown (you can't play the board in Omaha). Our Omaha confrontation
is 
\back\back\back\back\nines\Qd\Jd\tres\fourd\ against
\back\back\back\back\nines\Qd\Jd\tres\fourd\ . Players share the same five
upcards. Because players now have nine cards to make a five card poker
hand from, you get some very high poker hands being made in Omaha.

In Omaha you can make 60 different poker hands. You must use two of
your four hole cards, and there's six ways of doing that, combined
with three of the five board cards, and there's ten ways of doing
that. Six times ten is 60, and that's a lot of poker hands.

With that many different hands possible, Omaha like Stud can be played
as a High-only game or a High-Low Split game. Typically Omaha High is
played with Pot Limit betting (Pot Limit Omaha, ``PLO'') and Omaha
High-Low is played with Fixed Limit betting (though it can be played
Pot Limit). You can use different hole cards to make your best high
hand and your worst low hand, as always you have to use exactly two of
your hole cards both times. If there's not three unpaired cards
eight-or-lower on the Finalboard, nobody can make a low hand and the
entire pot goes to the best High Hand for this deal.

Reading the Board in Omaha is the same as it is in Holdem. Because
players can't use Single-Card hands in Omaha, you don't get outdrawn
by a flush if a fourth suited card comes on the turn; someone either
already had the flush on the flop or they can't make one. You also
don't lose to a Single-Card full house if the Board double-pairs on
the river. There are no Single-Card hands allowed in Omaha.

Movie: \textbf{Euro Rounders}. There isn't actually an Omaha movie
yet, but someone on the Internet wrote a fun Rounders Parody, called
Euro Rounders. Instead of Mike taking on Teddy KGB at No Limit Holdem
in the United States, Michel takes on Teddy CIA in Europe's most
sophisticated game, Pot Limit Omaha.

\subsection{The next big poker game}

A lot of the new poker games have come from the online world. Online
poker sites don't have to pay dealers or supervisors so they can run
games that are uneconomic in a Casino; such as microstakes games (two
cent/four cent blinds) and huge field freerolls. The poker games they
come up with are limited only by the imagination of the programmers,
and what people on the sites want to play. Some of the new games
in poker in the last ten years are Six-Max games (six players only to
a table) and short-deck Holdem (using a 36-card deck; the twos,
threes, fours and fives are taken out). Five-card Omaha is also
gaining traction. One of my favourites is Bagudi; a Fixed Limit
triple-draw game where players get four cards and the best low hand of
all-different suits and ranks wins. Time will tell if any of these new
games become the sixth major game in poker's history. I think No Limit
Holdem will be the major poker game for the next thirty years.

Traditionally the most popular mixed poker game is H.O.R.S.E; with
Holdem, Omaha, Razz (Seven Card Stud Low), Seven Card Stud and
Eight-or-Better (Seven Card Stud High-Low) making the five games.
Some of the new games are creeping into mixed-game cash and tournament
play; with eight or eleven different games now seen.

\section{The Betting}

Poker betting has changed over the years. In some poker games
a player could bet, call or be raised whatever a fair estimation of
his wealth was. If you got the bad beat of all time (Quads against
a Straight Flush) it could cost you everything you had. Such crazy
betting was unsustainable and the reputation of poker
improved markedly with the rule that you could only play with the
chips you had on the table, \textbf{Table Stakes}.

Once poker became a widespread Casino game, Fixed Limit betting was
king. Casinos had an interest in keeping a large number of players
sitting at the table for a long time. You can shear a sheep many times,
and you can play Fixed Limit Poker for hours on end; losing steadily
and sometimes booking a good win, and the Casino generates fully-raked
pots in most of the hands.

% FIXME: Cite the fun Jesse May quote here.

Players got frustrated at the small wins and the amount of time needed
to win big at Fixed Limit, so a demand for No Limit games was created,
especially after people had seen footage of No Limit Tournaments on TV.
In a No Limit Game you risk being skinned not sheared; Casinos kept
the games more manageable with fixed buyin limits. Star Casino's buyin limits
have changed over the years; their smallest game at one stage was
\$2/\$3 with a minimum buyin of \$80 and a maximum of \$200. In March 2020
the buyin range for this game was \$200 to \$500.

Pot Limit betting sits between Fixed Limit and No Limit. It works very
well in Omaha and makes for a big action game, while still letting you
see most flops for an affordable price. Holdem was played Pot Limit for
a while (Jeff Lisandro came second to Allen Cunningham in a WSOP Pot Limit
Holdem Event in 2006) but there isn't much Pot Limit Holdem any more.
Seven Card stud can be played Pot Limit; though Fixed Limit
is more common. Draw Poker games today are normally Fixed Limit or No Limit.

\section{Tournament Poker}

Tournament Poker began in 1970 in Las Vegas with the World Series of
Poker; still the most important poker tournament series in the world
and the series that crowns Poker's World Champion. The first few years
of the WSOP Main Event were very different to poker tournaments today.
They were winner-takes-all and the only way to enter the
tournament was to pay \$10,000 of your own money to play.
When Doyle Brunson won his second WSOP Main Event, he got to keep
all the buyins from the twenty-six other players.
