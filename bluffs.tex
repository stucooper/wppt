\chapter{Bluffs}

% Last updated: 20200428

People who haven't played a lot of poker think that the game
is all about Bluffs and Tells. While they're an important
part of the game, they're not the be-all and end-all.

I've covered a lot of Position bluffs that you should be making
regularly throughout a Fast Tournament. One of them was
Blind Stealing. This chapter covers a few other bluffs that you can
make yourself or look out for from the other players.

\section{Entitlement Bluff}

Sometimes there's a wet flop but the Turn and River give no help
to the obvious draws. The Finalboard \Jd\tend\fivec\twoh\sixh\ started
pretty wet but the runout didn't complete high straights or the
Diamond flush. A flopped Made Hand would expect to still be the winner
here.

A player who flopped a good draw feels entitled to winning
this pot, and will call a bet on the flop, a bet on the turn
and try bluffing on the river when his draw misses. I call
this bluff an Entitlement Bluff.

The key to understanding Entitlement Bluffs is that if the Enemy had a
better made hand than you, he would have raised on either the flop or
the turn, because he doesn't know that you're not on the draw, and he
needs to protect his strong made hand against getting outdrawn. If the
Enemy has just been calling on a Wet Flop and Wet Turnboard, the most
likely reason is he was drawing himself.

An Entitlement Bluff is usually easy to spot and call down; it
just smells wrong. It doesn't make sense from the three street action
``he's behind on the flop, he's behind on the turn, the river
didn't change anything and now he's betting?? That's got to be
a bluff- I call!''.

I've made some pretty bad Entitlement Bluffs and easily called
other people's Entitlement Bluffs. When I'm the leader on
an unchanged Board and I'm first to act, I'll often check the
river to induce an Entitlement Bluff. I can't get Three Streets
of Value by betting it myself, my best play is to check/call here.

If I'm last to act as the leader, I'll call an Entitlement Bluff
if he's made one, and Value Bet or Check Behind if he's checked.
I'll value bet if I have a good two pair hand or a set; if I've
got just a single pair (even top/top) I'll often check behind
because drawing hands can sometimes sneak two pair (in this example,
\sixd\fived\ misses the flush but spikes a call-worthy two pair
on the river). A value bet in this circumstance risks being one
of those bets that only gets called when I'm losing.

% FIXME: Change the wording to be Single-Card Double-Card etc.

\section{Scary Board Bluff}

A Scary Board is one where there's four-to-a-flush or four-to-a-straight.
A board showing Two Pairs is also Scary, on that board there's
four-to-a-fullhouse.  On Scary Boards it's obvious that the
right one-card hand makes a powerful hand. Normally this is a
cooler situation and betting slows down with check-check, but it's
also an opportunity to make a daring big bluff called the Scary Board Bluff.

Scary Board Bluffs can get Two pair or even Sets to fold, if they're
big enough.

\section{Blind Re-Steal}

You won't be the only player trying to steal the blinds, especially
as the blinds get big and on final table play. Other players will
be trying to steal your Blinds.

When you're in the Blinds, you get to act in late position for
the first round of betting only. If you consider a bettor is
trying to steal your blinds, you can reraise and try to
get him to fold.

This bet will be pretty big and if you get it wrong you can
lose a ton of chips if not your Tournament life. But if you get
it right you'll win a lot of chips and quieten down other
players at the table who now know it's not a pushover to steal
your blinds.

This move is High Risk/High Reward.

When considering a re-steal, consider two factors of the player who
raised preflop. What do you know about him, and what position did he
raise from? If the raise came from early position, it's probably not a
Blind Steal, unless you've got a read on this player as being pretty
wild. A bet from the Button or Cut-off after a bunch of folds is more
likely to be a Steal and your Re-Steal is more likely to succeed. Wild
players get dealt good starting cards, and they get dealt good
starting cards on the Button and the Cut-off. If your Re-steal gets
snapped off and you lose to a powerful hand, never mind, at least you
went down fighting.
