Imagine if every time you bought a meal at McDonalds the staff
said something insulting to you, like ``You're an idiot''. They'd
soon go out of business. Service and Hospitality staff are trained
to be polite to the customers and poker players should be polite to
each other.

A few poker players have got it into their heads that nastiness
and putting other players on tilt is a crucial part of the game.
It isn't. If you berate bad players when they get lucky against
you, you'll create a poisionous atmosphere that, over time, will
drive the nice guys and weaker players out of the game. There's plenty
of other things they can do with their time. And once the nice
guys all leave the game, Tournament poker will just be a small
bunch of jerks fighting over the scraps of a tiny prizepool. I don't
want that, and neither do you.

If you're a winning poker player, the other poker players are
your customers. Be nice to your customers.

The etiquette at Pub Tournaments is normally great, at a much
better level than Casino cash games, where needling other players
and getting them to make big mistakes \textbf{is} an important
part of the game. Here's a list of etiquette suggestions that
make a Pub Poker game even better.

\begin{description}

\item[Never Slowroll]  There's nothing clever about showing your hand
as late as possible and tricking the other showdown player into thinking
he's the winner. Slowrolling is hated by poker players for a 
reason.\footnote{Tommy Angelo's fantastic book, Elements of Poker, has
a whole section on showdown etiquette, which he calls Sixth Street}
Don't do it. You're better than that.

\item[Shake the hand of the player who busts you] Look the winner in the
eye, shake his hand and say ``Nice hand, sir'' or ``you got lucky there''.
Wish the winner and the other players at your table good luck for the
rest of the Tournament: ``Good luck everybody'' is the phrase I always use.

If you're at the final table and there's only 5 or 6 players left you
might like to shave everyone's hand, starting with the player who
busted you. If you're in the money, move to the side so that play
can continue, and attract the attention of a Tournament Director who
can get your payout.


\item[Players can play their hand however they want] Anyone playing in
a Poker Tournament can play their hand in any way they want. They
can stay in with 52 on an AAQ board and crack your AK with a runout
of AAQ43 if they want. Don't berate bad players. If you must say
something, a sarcastic ``Nice hand, sir'' or ``well player, sir'' should
be enough.
