\chapter{Made Hand versus Drawing Hand}

This chapter is a lengthy examination of the Old Poker Saying, ``Poker
is a battle between a Made Hand versus a Drawing Hand''.

Hands like Top Pair/Top Kicker and Two Pairs and Sets turn up on the
Flop and are usually the best Five card poker hand anyone can
make. But by the time that the turn and river come out and there's the
full Five Community Cards for players to use, Straights and Flushes
are often possible.

For the purposes of this chapter, I'm going to label some hands on the
poker ladder; ignoring the top hand (Straight Flush, very rare) and
the bottom hand (High Card). Quads and Full Houses are \textbf{Monster
Hands}, Flushes and Straights are \textbf{Power Hands} and Three of a
Kind, Two Pairs and Pairs are \textbf{Made Hands}.

\section{Reading the Board}

One of the great attractions of Holdem Poker is every player can see,
from the Final Board, what the Nuts is. If the Board doesn't have a
pair, then nobody has a full house or quads. If the Board doesn't have
at least three of a suit, nobody has a flush. If the Board doesn't
have at least three connected cards in a continuum of five, nobody has
a straight. Players soon learn to recognise when they have the Nuts,
and it's one of the great things about Holdem.

The most popular game before Holdem was Seven Card Stud. In Seven Card
Stud, each player still in the hand at the final betting street has their
own unique seven card hand, with four of those cards visible to the
other player. A player's final hand looks like
\back\back\nines\Qc\Jc\tred\back\ . With three hidden cards, it's possible
for this player to have a full house, quads, a Club flush or a Straight.
Indeed, with three hidden cards, it's always possible for a player to have
Quads or a Full House.

In an earlier game, Five Card Stud, you got to see too much of a
player's hand. Each player still in at the end have five unique cards
but four of them were visible. A player's final hand in Five Card Stud
looks like \back\nines\Qc\Jc\tred\ . With only five cards in his hand,
it's hard to make any kind of poker hand at all higher than a pair.

In Draw poker games, players have five cards to themselves and they're
all private. Here's a player's hand after the final draw in Draw
Poker: \back\back\back\back\back\ . If he drew one card in his draw,
he might've had two pair looking for a full house, four cards to a
flush, four cards to a straight, trips and he's only drawing one card
not two for deception, any kind of hand really. Draw poker gives you
little information at all.

Holdem poker gives you just the right amount of information. Draw
Poker has no information. Five Card Stud has Too Much Information and
with only Five Cards the hands made are boringly low. Seven Card Stud
has a good mix of downcards and upcards but with three private cards
not two it's still not exactly right for some people. Seven Card Stud
is a fine game and deserves to be played a lot more than it is, in my
opinion. Holdem hits the perfect sweet spot of five upcards and two
downcards per player. With the five upcards shared between all
players, it's possible for a player to know he's got the unbeatable
Nuts, regardless of any other player's downcards.
