\chapter{Made Hand versus Drawing Hand}

This chapter is a lengthy examination of the Old Poker Saying, ``Poker
is a battle between a Made Hand versus a Drawing Hand''.

Hands like Top Pair/Top Kicker and Two Pairs and Sets turn up on the
Flop and are usually the best Five card poker hand anyone can
make. But by the time that the turn and river come out and there's the
full Five Community Cards for players to use, Straights and Flushes
are often possible.

For the purposes of this chapter, I'm going to label some hands on the
poker ladder; ignoring the top hand (Straight Flush, very rare) and
the bottom hand (High Card). Quads and Full Houses are \textbf{Monster
Hands}, Flushes and Straights are \textbf{Power Hands} and Three of a
Kind, Two Pairs and Pairs are \textbf{Made Hands}.

\textbf{Reading the Board}

One of the great attractions of Holdem Poker is every player can see,
from the Final Board, what the Nuts is. If the Board doesn't have a
pair, then nobody has a full house or quads. If the Board doesn't have
at least three of a suit, nobody has a flush. If the Board doesn't
have at least three connected cards in a continuum of five, nobody has
a straight. Players soon learn to recognise when they have the Nuts,
and it's one of the great things about Holdem.

The most popular game before Holdem was Seven Card Stud. In Seven Card
Stud, each player still in the hand at the final betting street has their
own unique seven card hand, with four of those cards visible to the
other player. A player's final hand looks like
\back\back\nines\Qc\Jc\tred\back\ . With three hidden cards, it's possible
for this player to have a full house, quads, a Club flush or a Straight.
Indeed, with three hidden cards, it's always possible for a player to have
Quads or a Full House.
