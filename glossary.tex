Poker has its own language, it applies special meaning to some
common English words and also has some terms all of its own. You
don't need to know all the jargon but I've used the following terms
in the book and a brief explanation here should be useful.

\begin{description}

\item[Ace Magnets] Pocket Kings. When you have this holding, an Ace is
magically attracted to the flop, to make this hand tough to play for
you.

\item[Backdoor] A hand made using both the turn and river cards. Also
called Runner-Runner.

\item[Bad Beat] A player losing the pot on the turn or the river when
he was the clear favourite.

\item[Bettor] The person making the bet. In this book I spell it ``Bettor''
and use the spelling ``better'' to mean ``preferable''.

\item[Big Blind] Both the player two left of the dealer and the amount
he has to bet before he gets any cards. It will be obvious from the
context which meaning I'm using. In the sentence ``the big blind bets
1,000'' I'm talking about a bet from that player, when I say ``he had
a stack of 5 big blinds'' I'm taking about the amount. Sometimes I
call the amount the Big Bet.

\item[Big Slick] The hole cards Ace-King.

\item[Blank] A Blank is a turn card or river card that doesn't
complete any drawing hands. Also called a Brick or a Rag. On a flop of
JT6 two diamonds, a 3 of clubs on the turn is a Blank.

\item[Blocking Bet] A bet made by a player to try to forestall a
bigger bet. It's an attempt to set the bet size for this betting
street.

\item[Board] Another name for the Community Cards. The first three
cards make the Flop, adding the Turn makes the four card Community the
Turnboard and adding the River makes the Finalboard.

\item[Bubble] The finishing position just outside the money payments.
If seven places are paid, the eight place finisher has ended On the
Bubble, and gets the same payout as the first busted out player. Zero.

\item[Button] Both the player in the dealing position and a small
piece of plastic with ``Dealer'' written on it that indicates the
dealing position. This is the best playing position in Holdem.

\item[Card Dead] A player who is being dealt trash holdings in every
hand is said to be Card Dead.

\item[Case Card] The fourth and final card of a rank in the deck. If
you've got AA and you're all in on a flop of KK6 and the Enemy has AK,
you will only win if the turn or the river is the Case Ace.

\item[Cbet] A Continuation Bet, a bet made on the flop by the same Bettor
who raised preflop.

\item[Cbluff] A Continuation Bet you make when you're bluffing, you're
hoping to win the pot right now.

\item[Check] The action of not betting, in a betting round where
nobody else has bet and there's no bet to match to stay in the hand.

\item[Checking it Down] The behaviour of active players when another
player is all-in. The active players often check the later betting
streets, to keep everyone in the pot and maximise the chances that the
all-in player will lose the showdown and be eliminated.

\item[Complete Hand] A complete hand is a five-card poker hand where
you're using all five of your cards. Your hand doesn't have a kicker
in it. The Complete Hands are Full Houses, Flushes and Straights.

\item[Cooler] A big hand where a player loses a lot of his chips with
a big hand, to an even bigger hand. These hands often see a Go-Broke
hand run into the Nuts.

\item[Cooler Card] A board card, on the turn or river, that makes a
single card straight or flush possible. This card usually cools down
the betting from Made Hands, who are now afraid they've been outdrawn.

\item[Counterfeited] When your two pair hand is ruined by an unrelated
board pair. If you hold 76 on a board of AJ76 and the river comes a J,
you've been counterfeited.

\item[Crying Call] A call you make on the river where you expect to
lose the pot (and start crying!). Just to be 100\% sure, you make the
crying call.

\item[Current Nuts] The Current Nuts is the best possible hand, at a
stage of a deal before the Finalboard. Preflop the current nuts is
Pocket Aces, on the flop, top set is often the current nuts.

\item[Cutoff] The player who acts immediately before the Button.

\item[Dead Money] A player with no chance of winning the tournament.
He's paid his entry fee and his money is in the prizepool but he's
never going to be winning any money himself.

\item[Dominated] A player with the same high hole card as his opponent
but a lower side card is said to be dominated and will usually be
only a 30\% chance to win a showdown against that hand.

\item[Downstream] Players who act after you are downstream.

\item[Drawing Hand] A hand on the flopstreet or turnstreet that has
the potential to develop to a complete hand, such as a Full House,
Flush or Straight.

\item[Finalboard] The Five-card Board once the River has been
produced.

\item[Flop] The first three Board cards.

\item[Flopstreet] The round of betting immediately after the flop is
produced. This is the second of four betting rounds. I made this word
up but I like it a lot. Some veteran players who've played a lot of
Seven Card stud call this betting round ``Third Steet''

\item[Fold] To give up your cards and finish your involvement in this
hand. You lose whatever chips you've contributed to the pot so far.

\item[Free Card] A turn or river card that active players get to see
for free, because everyone checked on the betting round before it.

\item[Heads Up] A hand with just two players remaining. When a poker
tournament is down to the last two players, all remaining hands are
Heads Up.

\item[Holding] Your two private cards you get to hold as long as
you're involved in a hand. Another name for your hole cards.

\item[Hole Cards] The two private cards unique to each player.

\item[Hollywood] To put on a deliberate act, like you're in a
Hollywood film. I sometimes Hollywood my folds but rarely anything
else.

\item[Live Cards] A player who can win a showdown by pairing one of
his hole cards is said to have Live Cards. In an AK v J7 matchup, the
player with J7 can win by pairing his Jack or his Seven.

\item[Overcard] A hole card of yours that's bigger than any of the
cards on the community. When you hold A8 and the flop comes T75,
you're holding one Overcard. If you've got KJ on that flop of T75,
you've got two overcards, or ``two overs''.

\item[Preflop] The first betting street, before the flop is produced.
All you've got to go on is your own two hole cards and your estimation
of the strength of the other player's hole cards.

\item[Rainbow] All different suits; there is no flush
draw going to the next card. A flop is rainbow when there's three
different suits. A Turnboard is rainbow when there are four different
suits on it. A Finalboard is rainbow when there is not
three or more of any suit on it. If a turnboad has two diamonds, a
spade and a heart it isn't rainbow, but when the river comes a spade,
the Finalboard is rainbow.

\item[River] The fifth and final Board card. Once the River has been
shown, the five-card Board is the Finalboard and the final round of
betting takes place.

\item[Set] A set is a three of a kind hand where you hold two of the
three in your own hand. Your hole cards are a pocket pair which
matches one of the board cards. When you hold 66 and the flop is A63,
you've flopped a set of sixes. See \textbf{Trips}.

\item[Semibluff] A semibluff is a bet or raise with a drawing hand on
the flopstreet or the turnstreet. You don't have the best hand right
now, so your betting action is a bluff, however if you catch the right
board card your hand will develop into what you expect to be the best
hand. Typically a semibluffing hand is a straight draw, a flush draw,
or two overcards.

\item[Sit and Go] A single table No Limit Holdem tournament, usually
with 8 to 10 players starting and the top 2 or 3 players
paid. Sometimes a Sit and Go is a 10 player winner-take-all
first-prize-only satellite to a bigger game, with an entry fee of a
bit over 10\% of the bigger prize. For example you play a 10-person
Sit and Go for \$60, the only prize of which is an entry to a \$550
tournament.

\item[Scare Card] A card on the turn or river that makes a draw hit.
With two diamonds on the flop, a diamond on the river is a scare card.
A Coolear Card is an even more scary Scare Card, making powerful
Single-Hand hands possible.

\item[Small Blind] Both the player one left of the dealer and the
amount of money he has to bet before he gets any cards. See
\textbf{Big Blind}. Sometimes because of a player bustout or player
move there's no small blind posted; in every hand of poker there is at
least a Big Blind preflop.

\item[Tank] To tank is to take a long time over the decision
(you give it a lot of consideration, you go into the Thinktank).
Once you make your decision, you've tank-folded, tank-called, tank-bet,
tank-raised or tank-reraised.

\item[Trips] Trips is a three of a kind hand where you hold one of the
three in your hole cards. If you have A6 and the flop is 766, you've
flopped trip sixes. See \textbf{Set}.

\item[Turn] The fourth board card. It is produced after the Flopstreet
betting round is complete.

\item[Turnboard] The four-card Board after the Turn has been shown.

\item[Turnstreet] The round of betting immediately after the turn is
produced. This is the third of four betting rounds. This is one
of my invented terms. Some veteran players who've played a lot of
Seven Card stud call this betting round ``Fourth Steet''

\item[Upstream] Players who act before you. Remember to watch them
preflop before you even look at your own hole cards.
