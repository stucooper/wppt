Poker has its own language, it applies special meaning to some
common English words and also has some terms all of its own. You
don't need to know all the jargon but I've used the following terms
in the book and a brief explanation here should be useful.

\begin{description}

\item[Bettor] The person making the bet. In this book I spell it ``Bettor''
and use the spelling ``better'' to mean ``preferable''.

\item[Big Blind] Both the player two left of the dealer and the amount
he has to bet before he gets any cards. It will be obvious from the context which
meaning I'm using. In the sentence ``the big blind bets 1,000'' I'm talking about a bet
from that player, when I say ``he had a stack of 5 big blinds'' I'm taking about the
amount. Sometimes I call the amount the Big Bet.

\item[Button] Both the player in the dealing position and a small piece
of plastic with ``Dealer'' written on it that indicates the dealing position.
The plastic token used to be called the ``Buck'' and it's that Buck that's in the
US phrase ``The Buck Stops Here''.

\item[Cbet] A Continuation Bet, a bet made on the flop by the same Bettor
who raised preflop.

\item[Cbluff] A Continuation Bet you make when you're bluffing, you're hoping
to win the pot right now.

\item[Counterfeited] When your two pair hand is ruined by an unrelated board pair.
If you hold 76 on a board of AJ76 and the river comes a J,
you've been counterfeited.

\item[Crying Call] A call you make on the river where you expect to lose the pot
(and start crying!). Just to be 100\% sure, you make the crying call.

\item[Cutoff] The player who acts immediately before the Button.

\item[Downstream] Players who act after you are downstream.

\item[Heads Up] A hand with just two players remaining. When a poker tournament
is down to the last two players, all remaining hands are Heads Up.

\item[Hollywood] To put on a deliberate act, like you're in a Hollywood film. I
sometimes Hollywood my folds but rarely anything else.

\item[Set] A set is a three of a kind hand where you hold two of the three in your
own hand. Your hole cards are a pocket pair which matches one of the board cards.
When you hold 66 and the flop is A63, you've flopped a set of sixes. See \textbf{Trips}.

\item[Sit and Go] A single table No Limit Holdem tournament, usually with 8 to 10
players starting and the top 2 or 3 players paid. Sometimes a Sit and Go is
a satellite to a bigger game, with an entry fee of a bit under 10\%. For
example you play a 10-person Sit and Go for \$60, the prize of which
is an entry to a \$550 tournament.

\item[Small Blind] Both the player one left of the dealer and the amount of money he
has to bet before he gets any cards. See \textbf{Big Blind}.

\item[Trips] Trips is a three of a kind hand where you hold one of the three in your
hole cards. If you have A6 and the flop is 766, you've flopped trip sixes. See \textbf{Set}.

\item[Upstream] Players who act before you. Remember to watch them preflop before
you even look at your own hole cards.
