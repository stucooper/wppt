\chapter{Freeroll Win}

% Last updated: 20181108

While I've been working on this book I've been playing more
pub poker and I won a 41 player Freeroll at my local
Bowling Club on Wednesday 7th November. Here's how I
did it.


\section{Game conditions}

This game had just about all of the Niggles that I hate.
Spend cards, early bird bonus, and a token extra \$2 fee
for double stack start, on a Freeroll. I mentioned that
Niggles are more prevalent in the Freeroll world, this
game set out to prove me right.

I don't as a rule normally play Freerolls but I'd been stuck
at home all day on a Wednesday and was feeling a bit Stir Crazy.
A 5 minute drive up the road to the Bowling Club seemed like
a good idea. If nothing else, it would give me some real life
experience of Freerolls to write about in this book.

% FIXME: Add the buyin and all the niggles involved.

\section{Early stages}

I was at an 8-seater table and folded a few hands before
making my first position play of the night, getting someone
to lay down a pretty good middle pair hand when I had nothing.
Because I'd done the spend card and an early bird bonus I actually
had the chip advantage over many of the players at the table
(it's actually nice to be on the \textbf{good} side of an
unlevel playing field!). 

In the first level I did a pot-builder preflop raise with T7,
got a bunch of callers and got the dream flop of 986! I cbetted
500 into an 800 pot and the player to my immediate left
insta-shoved for 5500 with Q9!! A third player (holding 87) tank-folded
and I had to wait patiently for my turn to call holding the nuts.
The runout was 986TA so I had to dodge a Jack on the river,
and just as well that the tank folder did fold his 87 otherwise we
would have split with me.

I made a couple of mistakes in the early level. On the button I held
22, put in a pot-build raise and got a dry flop of Q82, my cbet
folded three players and I won a small pot with a set, never a
good outcome. I should have let players see a free turn there, Q82
is a desert-dry flop.

Another hand I was underpaid for saw me with 95 on a QJ8 flop. I was
check-calling on the flop and turn and the runout was an interesting
QJ876; making me the second-nut low straight but really it
should be a winner, I doubt anyone had T9 for the flopped nut straight.
I bet out on the river and got the bettor and others to fold, I should
have check-raised on the river, the original bettor (holding JT)
would have value bet a third time but my strong lead got him to fold
as he didn't even have a two pair hand.

\section{Middle stages}

At the break I had a stack of 31,550 which I'll call 31k for simplicity.
This was after the 25/50, 50/100, 100/200, 150/300 and 200/400 levels.
With the blinds increasing to 300/600, I still had a 50 BB stack.

I went card dead for a while, but still making position plays here
and there. One hand I had As4s, flopped a nut flush draw but slowed
right down and missed on the river; I'd paid 5000 to see the turn,
got a free river after the board paired but missed everything and
lost to trips, good play by me to take the free river as I would
have been wasting chips with a turn bet and could even have been
check-raised.

After the blinds hit 500/1000, all increases were straight blind doubles.
The blinds started to bite and I hit some good hands, an under-the-gun
pocket KK limp-raising a lot and busting a smaller stack's 77. I love
the UTG limp-raise, and it was a good one here as on the runout of
AJ4J3 I could well have lost to an Ace or a Jack.

I butted heads a few times against the oldest player at the table,
who was quite a canny player. He was a rock preflop, never raising,
often folding, but limping with very strong hands like Ace-Queen.
He often flopped top/top and was able to call my bluffs on every
street and win plenty of chips from me. He did shove all in for
about 40,000 with blinds at 300/600 holding AA, picking up just
the blinds for that hand, which I thought was very bad play.

I doubled through him when my stack was down to about 25k; holding
Q8 I got the priceless flop QQ8. I called his bets all the way
until on the final board of QQ866 I raised his 2000 bet all in
for another 19k; he held 86 and it was too hard a fold for him
so he made the call.

The player on my left was shoving all in for his 25k after some
of my limps, I got tired of this and took a stand with 76. He
held AJ but I rivered a pair on a nothing board to send him
home. Some very good luck for me there, really I had superb
card luck the whole night. Soon I was at the final table of
Nine players.
